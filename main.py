"""
GTK Signage Application - Main Entry Point

This script serves as the entry point for the GTK Signage application.
It starts a Flask web server in a background thread for administration
and initializes the GTK window for displaying slides.

The application combines a web-based admin interface with a GTK-based
display that shows slides according to configured settings.
