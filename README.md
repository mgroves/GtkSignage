# GTK Signage

A lightweight digital signage solution that combines a GTK-based display with a web-based management interface. Perfect for information displays, menu boards, and other digital signage needs. Designed with Raspberry Pi in mind.

## Features

- **Simple Web-Based Management**: Add, edit, and delete slides through an intuitive web interface
- **Flexible Content Display**: Show web pages or (uploaded) images
- **Scheduling**: Set start and end times for each slide to control when content is displayed
- **Secure Admin Interface**: Password-protected admin console
- **Lightweight**: Minimal dependencies and system requirements, single process
- **Easy Installation**: installation script for Linux systems
- **SSL Support**: Optional HTTPS for secure admin access
- **Caching**: Saving local copies of URL slides (and associated JS/CSS/images) in case internet goes out

## Requirements

### System Requirements
- Linux system with systemd
- Python 3
- GTK 3.0
- WebKit2

### Python Dependencies
- Flask, Flask-WTF
- Jinja2
- python-dotenv
- requests
- beautifulsoup4
- filelock

## Installation

### Automatic Installation (Recommended)

```bash
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mgroves/GtkSignage/prod/install.sh)
```

The installation script will:
1. Install required system dependencies
2. Clone the repository to `/opt/gtk-signage`
3. Prompt for admin username and password
4. Configure .env variables (Flask host and port, passwords, settings)
5. Optionally enable HTTPS with self-signed certificates
6. Set up a systemd service to run at boot

## Usage

### Accessing the Admin Interface

After installation, the admin interface is available at:
- HTTP: `http://<your-ip>:<port>/admin`
- HTTPS (if enabled): `https://<your-ip>:<port>/admin`

Log in with the username and password you provided during installation.

### Managing Slides

1. **Adding Slides**:
   - Click "Add Slide" in the admin interface
   - Enter a URL or upload a local image
   - Set the duration (in seconds)
   - Optionally set start and end times (leave both blank to always display)
   - Click "Save"

2. **Editing Slides**:
   - Click "Edit" next to the slide you want to modify
   - Update the slide properties
   - Click "Save"

3. **Deleting Slides**:
   - Click "Delete" next to the slide you want to remove
   - Confirm the deletion

### Slide Properties

- **Source**: URL or upload image file
- **Duration**: How long to display the slide (in seconds)
- **Start Time**: When the slide should start being displayed (optional)
- **End Time**: When the slide should stop being displayed (optional)
- **Hide**: Manually hide a slide without deleting it

## Configuration

GTK Signage is configured through environment variables, which can be set in the `.env` file:

- `ADMIN_USERNAME`: Username for the admin interface
- `ADMIN_PASSWORD`: Password for the admin interface
- `FLASK_SECRET_KEY`: Secret key for Flask sessions (default: automatically generated by install)
- `FLASK_HOST`: Host to bind the Flask server (default: 0.0.0.0)
- `FLASK_PORT`: Port for the Flask server (default: 6969)
- `USE_SSL`: Enable HTTPS (true/false)
- `CACHE_DIR`: Subfolder to store cached web content (default: 'cache')
- `CACHE_EXPIRY_HOURS`: How many hours to keep cache contente (default: 48)


## Data Storage

Slides are stored in a JSON file (`slides.json`) in the following format:

```json
[
    {
        "source": "https://example.com/slide1",
        "duration": 10,
        "start": "2023-01-01T00:00:00",
        "end": "2023-12-31T23:59:59",
        "hide": false
    },
    { ... etc ... }
]
```

### Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Why did you create this?**  
A: I use digital signage in my ice cream store. I'm not satisfied with the options out there. They are too expensive, don't have any local caching, not reliable enough, too expensive, etc.

**Q: Why Python?**  
A: I don't like Python! But, GTK seemed like the way to go with displaying content, and since I couldn't make that work with .NET, I decided Python was the way to go.

**Q: Why not use Chromium kiosk mode?**
A: I think my system provides a much more manageable interface and platform, and doesn't rely on chromium, which can be quite a heavy process. GTK WebView only relies on WebKit.

**Q: Why did you do (weird thing in Python)?**
A: I'm not a Python developer. This was mostly developed with an AI coding assistant. I'm open to suggestions, and please don't assume I know beans about Python, Python ecosystem, or Python idioms.
